# Tic-Tac-Toe
2nd Project of the Odin's Project Javascript course. Will focus on using modular, dry, clean code and on using factory funtions instead of constructors.

Update: Learned a TON, the Javascript is the most crisp i've ever Written. Big thanks to MichaelOsman (https://github.com/michalosman/tic-tac-toe/blob/main/script.js#L112) , used come of his code as guide and borrowed some of the most complex methods.

The Architecture is 100% module based where all the modules do just one thing.

Thus, far the project is really simnple, barebones, however, the modular "Chain" that is the Javascipt, makes adding new features easier, so might do it in the future
